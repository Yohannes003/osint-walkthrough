## challange 3 

![alt text](IMG_2658.jpg)
*Now we are going to find the exact loaction of this place*
### steps 
#### 1, Finding clues in the image

*So now i have found two clues in this picture that might lead us to the exact location of this place*

![alt text](<Screenshot from 2024-07-19 05-38-23.png>)

*The first one is the building that has the **samsung Galaxy logo** in it and the second one is the **bus stop***

*The word on the bus stop sign says **KapitalBank** which helped in narrowing down the search space ... KapitalBank is Kapital Bank is a commercial bank operating in Azerbaijan which indicates that this picture was taken in **Azerbaijan , Baku***

*The building with the samsung logo wasn't that much help so i will be using **geospy.ai***

#### 2. observing the image 

*judging by the surroundings it looks like this picture is near bus/subway station after searching for bus/subway stations around Baku i couldn't find the place which indicates that the country/city that i got might be wrong*

*The privious OSINT challanges were in uzbekistan which then i used to search for all bus/subway stations near it and i got the exact place*
